NO default mappings for cycling through recent files are set. You have to do that yourself in your .vimrc

Even though Ctrl-M, Ctrl-C, and Ctrl-V are "taken", I found it more expedient to map them to cycle through the recent models, controllers, and views, respectively.

You will need to choose your OWN bindings and put these lines in your .vimrc, or copy these if you like them.

"cycles through last models
:nnoremap <C-m> :let g:vim_rails_recent_model = VimRailsRecentEditCycle(g:vim_rails_recent_model)<cr>

"cycles through last controllers
:nnoremap <C-c> :let g:vim_rails_recent_controller = VimRailsRecentEditCycle(g:vim_rails_recent_controller)<cr>

"cycles through last views
:nnoremap <C-v> :let g:vim_rails_recent_view = VimRailsRecentEditCycle(g:vim_rails_recent_view)<cr>


"this setting, which defaults to 5, will limit how many "recents" of any filetype are stored at once
let g:vim_rails_recent_depth = 5
